# Product Overview

## Product Description
Coherra is a high-performance container environment management tool that replaces existing container-use implementations with a Rust-based solution. It leverages Podman and bind-mount technology to achieve zero-copy operations and significant performance improvements.

## Core Features
- **Zero-copy file operations** through bind-mount strategy, eliminating Export/Import overhead
- **Ultra-fast git operations** achieving <120ms for single file commit on NVMe
- **Event-driven architecture** using filesystem notifications instead of polling
- **Memory-efficient logging** with ring buffer implementation (64KB or 512 lines cap)
- **Robust timeout management** for all external operations (run: 600s, git: 30s, startup: 30s)
- **MCP server implementation** for seamless integration with AI development environments
- **Cross-platform support** with specific Windows optimizations (Job Objects, long paths)

## Target Use Case
- **Development environments** requiring fast container-based isolation
- **AI-assisted coding workflows** through MCP protocol integration
- **CI/CD pipelines** needing reliable container management
- **Large repository management** with efficient git operations
- **Real-time file synchronization** between host and container

## Key Value Proposition
### Performance
- **120ms single file commit** performance target (vs seconds in traditional implementations)
- **<2s for 1000-file batch operations** through optimized git handling
- **Zero I/O overhead** with bind-mount eliminating file copying

### Reliability
- **Zero hanging** through explicit timeouts on all operations
- **Process tree management** ensuring clean termination
- **Non-interactive authentication** with fail-fast behavior
- **Graceful error handling** with resolution hints

### Efficiency
- **CPU usage reduction** by replacing 1-second polling with event-driven notifications
- **Memory bounded operations** preventing unbounded growth
- **Parallel port configuration** instead of serial processing
- **Native library usage** (gix/git2) instead of CLI spawning

## Development Status
Currently in initial development phase with MCP server foundation being implemented. The project aims to provide a production-ready replacement for container-use implementations with significant performance and reliability improvements.
